<img src="http://c1.soap.com/images/products/p/agx/agx-027_1z.jpg">

How can I stay so minty fresh, you ask? Here's how:

+ Re-read the 'catch-up' section on Object Orientation

+ PRACTICE! [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

+ Keep working through [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer) tutorials and problems.

+ BUILD! Pick real world objects and systems and build ruby models that simulate them!

+ Brush your teeth.
